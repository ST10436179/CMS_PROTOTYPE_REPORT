## Project Overview
This repository contains Part 1 of the Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) - Project Planning and Prototype Development. This phase focuses on creating a non-functional prototype including design documentation, UML diagrams, and a WPF interface prototype.

## üìã Deliverables
- Design documentation report (400-500 words)
- UML class diagram for database structure
- Project plan with timeline and dependencies
- WPF GUI prototype (non-functional)
- Version control history with 5+ commits

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Structure
The system uses a relational database model with three main entities:

### Classes and Attributes:
- **User** (UserId PK, Name, Email, PasswordHash, Role)
- **Claim** (ClaimId PK, UserId FK, HoursWorked, HourlyRate, TotalAmount, Status, SubmissionDate, ApprovalDate)
- **Document** (DocumentId PK, ClaimId FK, FileName, FilePath, UploadDate)

### Relationships:
- One User (Lecturer) ‚Üí Many Claims
- One Claim ‚Üí Many Documents

## üñ•Ô∏è GUI Prototype Features
- **Lecturer Submit Tab:** Claim submission form with hours worked, hourly rate, notes, and file upload
- **Approver View Tab:** ListView showing claims with Approve/Reject buttons
- **Track Status Tab:** DataGrid displaying claim history with status labels
